	* Initial import. Things currently working:
		* Can start and stop server processes individually or in a batch manner.
		Native resource acquisition and release is clean, elegant, and robust.
		* Launch configurations for processes are customizable - you can specify
		where each properties file is or where the WZ or scripts folder are.
		Some preferences are initialized to default values while some require
		the user to select a path on first startup. All of them can be edited in
		the GUI later on though.
		* You can customize the look and feel of the window. Layout is very
		loose and not at all rigid/absolute - the window will adapt to all
		platforms and all themes very elegantly.
		* Window will minimize to tray if functionality is available from the
		OS. A decent looking tray icon is provided.
		* A splash screen will assure the user that something is being done
		behind the scenes before the main window can be displayed.
