	* Initial import. Things currently working:
		* Can start and stop server processes individually or in a batch manner.
		Native resource acquisition and release is clean, elegant, and robust.
		* Launch configurations for processes are customizable - you can specify
		where each properties file is or where the WZ or scripts folder are.
		Some preferences are initialized to default values while some require
		the user to select a path on first startup. All of them can be edited in
		the GUI later on though.
		* You can customize the look and feel of the window. Layout is very
		loose and not at all rigid/absolute - the window will adapt to all
		platforms and all themes very elegantly.
		* Window will minimize to tray if functionality is available from the
		OS. A decent looking tray icon is provided.
		* A splash screen will assure the user that something is being done
		behind the scenes before the main window can be displayed.

	* Console tabs now should show a blank line after the last line of output
	* Use ProcessBuilder so that standard error is redirected to merge with
	standard output (of child process). This way, the BufferedReaders won't
	cause the input of each stream to be jumbled if they both send us data at
	almost the same time, and it makes StreamBasedConsoleTab much simpler as it
	only has to deal with one stream each for input and output.
	* InputBox's text field is disabled when the input stream is closed. This
	way, it is symmetrical with OutputBox's disableOutput method and we don't
	have to perform a null check in StreamBasedConsoleTab.textEntered since the
	text field should be disabled when openWriter is null, and hence no text can
	be entered.
	* Child process stream cleanup should be performed before calling waitFor
	on the process to avoid having to wait for a long time.
